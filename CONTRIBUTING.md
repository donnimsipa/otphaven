## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for type safety
- **React:** Functional components with hooks
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes (mobile-first)
- **Imports:** Use the importmap style defined in `index.html`
- **Formatting:** Keep code clean and readable

### Project Structure

- **No `src/` folder:** All source files are in the project root
- **Components:** Place reusable UI in `components/`
- **Services:** Place business logic in `services/`
- **Types:** Define interfaces in `types.ts`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
feat: add batch QR import feature
fix: resolve iOS Safari compatibility issue
docs: update deployment instructions
chore: update dependencies
security: improve encryption key derivation
```

### Security Considerations

- **Never log secrets** or passwords to console
- **Test encryption/decryption** thoroughly
- **Consider mobile browsers** (Safari, Firefox iOS)
- **Validate user input** before processing
- **Document security implications** of changes

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting:

1. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. Test on mobile devices (iOS and Android)
3. Test offline functionality
4. Test P2P sync between devices
5. Test import/export features
6. Verify encryption/decryption works correctly

## 📝 Changelog Updates

When making changes, update `CHANGELOG.md`:

- Add entry under `[Unreleased]` section
- Use appropriate category: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, etc.
- Write user-focused descriptions
- Move to versioned section when releasing

Example:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Batch QR code import from multiple image files

### Fixed
- QR scanner compatibility on iOS Safari
```

### Releasing a New Version

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions:

1. Update version in `package.json`:
   ```bash
   # Manually edit package.json or use npm version
   npm version patch  # 1.1.7 -> 1.1.8
   npm version minor  # 1.1.7 -> 1.2.0
   npm version major  # 1.1.7 -> 2.0.0
   ```

2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`:
   - Move `[Unreleased]` items to new version section
   - Add release date
   - Update version links at bottom

3. Update service worker cache version in `sw.js`:
   ```javascript
   const CACHE_NAME = 'otphaven-v1.1.8';
   ```

4. Commit and push to `master`:
   ```bash
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md sw.js
   git commit -m "chore: release v1.1.8"
   git push origin master
   ```

5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Create git tag (e.g., `v1.1.8`)
   - Create GitHub Release with changelog notes
   - Trigger Docker image builds
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

No need to manually run `git tag` or `git push --tags`!

## 🔒 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer directly (check package.json for contact)
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
